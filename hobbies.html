    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    My present work is actually been my lifetime passion, with hopes of one day
    helping mankind escape from our cradle in the solar system and explore the
    cosmos. However, I do enjoy spending my time pursuing the following
    activities.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Reading</h2>
        I like reading books related to sci-fi adventures and murder mysteries.
        Asimov and Michael Crichton are among my favourites in the sci-fi
        categories. Sleuths like Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot and Nancy Drew
        also inspire me.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Gardening</h2>
        I have always admired greenery and am an advocate for sustainability.
        This has stemmed from my deep connection with nature. I pride myself on
        having a green thumb. I plan to have a bonsai tree as my family
        heirloom.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Music</h2>
        A newly acquired hobby of mine, I am learning the guitar and hope to
        start a band someday. Wish me luck!
